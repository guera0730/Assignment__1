    <h1>Artisanal Mexican Candles</h1>
    <p>Bringing a smell of Mexico into your home while also having a beautiful piece of Mexico to display, my candles come in various scents such as arroz con leche, cafe de olla, atol de chocolate, and vanilla with lavender. When you are finished, simply boil the rest of the wax out and you can upcycle the pottery for its original intended purpose. You now have a salsa bowl, mug, or bean pot.</p></header>
